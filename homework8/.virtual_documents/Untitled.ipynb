#1c) Transit: Planet passes in front of star, Radial Velocity: Doppler shift of star shows planet, Microlensing: Gravitational Magnified light has a dip in it from a planet in the system, Imaging: Direct photo, TTV: A transit dip is irregular and can only be explained by another exoplanet, ETV: Eclipses of stars have irregularities which are due to an exoplanet, Disk Kinematics: Protoplanetry disk disturbances

# 4.5)
# Title: A temperate super-Jupiter imaged with JWST in the mid-infrared
# Summary: New JWST images revised previous models of the planet eps Ind A b which were previously reported.
# Yes my answer matches.
# This is the oldest directly imaged planet to date.
# The equillibrium temperature reported is exactly the same, the mass reported by the paper seems to be revised to be more consistent with a higher mass planet (8.6 vs 6.3)
